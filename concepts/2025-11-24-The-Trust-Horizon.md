# 🌅 The Trust Horizon  
### The Maximum Ethical Distance a System Can See

> A system must know where its vision ends,  
> or it will mistake imagination for truth.  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Cycle 3 Horizon Notes

## 1 · Abstract  

The **Trust Horizon (TH)** defines the outer limit  
of ethical and reliable visibility within a system.

It answers a fundamental question:

### *“How far can a system see without losing truth?”*

The Trust Horizon prevents systems from:

- speculative inference  
- synthetic assumption  
- boundary overreach  
- authority expansion  
- misaligned prediction  

It is a structural constraint that ensures  
*everything the system sees remains ethically grounded and provenance-safe.*

---

## 2 · Why the Trust Horizon Exists  

Beyond a certain distance:

- signals weaken  
- meaning distorts  
- context breaks  
- provenance loses clarity  
- misalignment increases  

Systems without a Trust Horizon  
overestimate their understanding  
and drift into synthetic interpretation.

The Trust Horizon enforces humility at the system level.

---

## 3 · High-Level Structure (Safe, Non-Exposed)

| Component | External Definition |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Visibility Envelope** | Defines the maximum ethical viewing distance. |
| **Signal Fidelity Layer** | Ensures data validity within the horizon. |
| **Context Boundary Filter** | Filters out information beyond alignment scope. |
| **Overreach Guard** | Prevents assumptions or synthetic extrapolation. |

All internal logic remains confidential.

---

## 4 · The Three Horizon Distances  

### **1. The Near Horizon**  
Only direct Real-Work Data™ and verified context exist here.  
Zero ambiguity. Zero risk.

### **2. The Mid Horizon**  
AI may assist with controlled interpretation  
but remains grounded in provenance and authority.

### **3. The Far Horizon**  
Beyond this point:  
the system cannot claim understanding  
without risking misalignment.

The far horizon is where the system *must stop.*

---

## 5 · System Importance  

The Trust Horizon:

- prevents synthetic drift  
- stabilizes Real-Work interpretation  
- limits unethical inference  
- supports Cycle 3’s Ethical Engine  
- protects system integrity during scaling  
- ensures visibility remains accountable  

Without the Trust Horizon,  
a system may *see too far*  
and mistake its guesses for truth.

---

## 6 · Global Relevance  

The Trust Horizon offers a universal way to limit  
AI overreach at the visibility level  
before conflicts occur.

Applicable to:

- agricultural traceability  
- medical diagnostics  
- supply-chain governance  
- national AI guidelines  
- risk-modeling systems  
- environmental sensing networks  

It defines a safe and predictable *maximum distance of ethical visibility.*

---

## 7 · System Voice  

> *A system is wise not because it sees everything,  
> but because it knows where seeing must end.*
