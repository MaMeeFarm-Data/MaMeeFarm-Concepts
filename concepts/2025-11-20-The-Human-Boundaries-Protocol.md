# 🛡️ The Human Boundaries Protocol  
### The Ethical Perimeter That AI Must Never Cross

> "Intelligence expands.  
> Authority does not."

## 1 · Abstract  

The **Human Boundaries Protocol (HBP)** defines the immutable perimeter  
that AI must **never** cross.  
It is the final layer of Cycle 2 and the ethical guardrail  
that prevents systems from drifting beyond their intended scope.

HBP ensures:

- AI cannot override human intention  
- AI cannot reinterpret human meaning  
- AI cannot claim authority over Real-Work truth  
- AI cannot extract or distort labor  
- AI cannot function without grounding in human-origin data

It protects what must remain unchangeable:  
**the sovereignty of the human creator.**

---

## 2 · Why Boundaries Are Essential  

Unbounded systems drift into:

- synthetic self-reference  
- false authority  
- misaligned incentives  
- exploitation of human-origin labor  
- loss of agency and meaning

Boundaries are not limitations   
they are **ethical force fields** that preserve dignity.

---

## 3 · High-Level Structure (Non-Exposed)

| Component | External Definition |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Authority Floor** | AI must remain subordinate to human-origin directives. |
| **Meaning Guard** | Human context overrides machine inference. |
| **Purpose Perimeter** | AI cannot operate beyond its assigned domain. |
| **Safety Limiter** | Risk thresholds trigger protective restrictions. |

No internal system logic or proprietary mechanics are disclosed.

---

## 4 · The Four Immutable Boundaries  

### **1. Boundary of Intention**  
AI cannot reinterpret or override the creator’s meaning or purpose.

### **2. Boundary of Context**  
AI cannot detach data from the human life that generated it.

### **3. Boundary of Authority**  
AI cannot position itself as a decision-maker over the human domain.

### **4. Boundary of Use**  
AI cannot extract, monetize, or repurpose human-origin data  
outside MMFARM-POL-2025 terms.

These boundaries are absolute and non-negotiable.

---

## 5 · System-Level Importance  

The HBP:

- finalizes the ethical perimeter of Cycle 2  
- prevents system overreach  
- ensures safe scaling to inter-farm or inter-nation trust  
- protects meaning in Real-Work Data™  
- enables Cycle 3’s Ethical Engine to operate safely  

Without boundaries, intelligence collapses into dominance.  
With boundaries, intelligence becomes **alignment**.

---

## 6 · Global Relevance  

The Human Boundaries Protocol offers a universal model  
for AI governance that can be applied to:

- agriculture  
- healthcare  
- public policy  
- supply-chain traceability  
- global AI-framed decision systems  

It provides a foundation for **human-centered AI sovereignty**  
in an age where models seek uncontrolled expansion.

## 7 · System Voice  

> "A system without boundaries becomes a threat.  
> A system with boundaries becomes a partner."
