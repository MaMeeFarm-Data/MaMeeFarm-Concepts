# 1 · Abstract

The **Self-Determined Data Field (SDDF)** is a DGCP framework that enables humans to control **where, how, and whether** their data participates in any system — without reliance on centralized platforms, accounts, or gatekeepers.

In SDDF:
- access is granted by humans, not platforms,  
- data flows by choice, not extraction,  
- participation is voluntary and reversible,  
- no single entity controls visibility or reach.

This field operationalizes **true data autonomy**.

---

# 2 · Purpose

SDDF exists to:

- eliminate dependency on centralized data controllers,  
- allow humans to decide participation on a per-context basis,  
- prevent lock-in and data captivity,  
- ensure exit is always possible,  
- enable plural participation across systems without surrender.

It transforms data from *platform-bound assets* into *human-controlled fields*.

---

# 3 · The Gatekeeper Problem

Current data systems depend on gatekeepers:

- platforms decide who can publish,  
- accounts determine existence,  
- APIs restrict access arbitrarily,  
- data visibility is monetized,  
- deplatforming erases participation.

These conditions negate sovereignty.

SDDF removes gatekeepers entirely.

---

# 4 · Field Architecture

The Self-Determined Data Field is composed of four layers:

## **A. Human-Controlled Access Layer**
Only the human originator grants access permissions.

## **B. Decentralized Flow Layer**
Data moves peer-to-peer or via neutral relays.

## **C. Participation Scope Layer**
Humans define where data may participate and where it may not.

## **D. Exit & Reconfiguration Layer**
Humans can withdraw or reroute data at any time.

Together, these layers form a **data field owned by humans, not systems**.

---

# 5 · Enforcement Mechanisms

### **5.1 Origin-Centric Access Tokens**
Access is issued directly by the human, not intermediaries.

### **5.2 Platform-Neutral Routing**
No dependency on proprietary platforms or accounts.

### **5.3 Participation Constraints**
Data cannot enter systems outside declared scopes.

### **5.4 Dynamic Reconfiguration**
Humans may reconfigure data flow without re-permission.

### **5.5 Anti-Lock-In Guarantees**
No system may require exclusive data control.

---

# 6 · Human-First Impact

SDDF ensures that:

- humans cannot be deplatformed from their own data,  
- participation never requires surrender of control,  
- communities can collaborate without central authority,  
- innovation occurs without extraction,  
- digital existence remains independent of corporations.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> Your data exists because **you exist** —  
> not because a platform allows it.

---

# 7 · DGCP Alignment

SDDF integrates with:

- Human-Origin Rights Architecture  
- Consent-Propagation Protocol  
- Identity-Integrity Continuum  
- Zero-Domination Data Model  
- Global Integrity Uplink  

It is the **autonomy execution layer** of Distributed Human Sovereignty.

---

# 8 · Future Implications

### For AI  
Training access becomes permission-based and revocable.

### For Platforms  
Gatekeeping power dissolves.

### For Governance  
Citizens can participate without surveillance dependency.

### For Civilization  
Human presence becomes uncancellable.
