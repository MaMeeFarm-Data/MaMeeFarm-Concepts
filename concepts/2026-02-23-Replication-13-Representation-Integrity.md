# Replication #13
## Representation Integrity
### Anti-Mischaracterization Rule

---

## 1. Abstract

Structural protection alone is insufficient if narrative distortion remains possible.

Replication #13 establishes protection against mischaracterization of DGCP™ governance status.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- prohibit false claims of open-source status,
- prevent rebranding of restricted governance as public-domain,
- block implied derivative ownership,
- prevent framing that alters license perception,
- preserve authoritative representation.

---

## 3. Prohibited Representations

Without written authorization, the following are prohibited:

- Claiming DGCP is open-source
- Suggesting public-domain availability
- Rebranding governance structure under alternative naming
- Presenting derivative frameworks as independent creation
- Implying authorization through silence

---

## 4. Integrity Logic

Language shapes perception.

Perception influences rights interpretation.

Representation control protects structural reality.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Mischaracterization creates silent drift.

Silent drift erodes enforcement clarity.

Representation integrity preserves governance authority.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
