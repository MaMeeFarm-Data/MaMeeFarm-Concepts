# 🔋 Implementation #5: Proof Continuity Under Resource Constraints  
### *Maintaining Continuous, Verifiable Truth When Money, Time, Energy, and Tools Are Limited*

> “If truth only survives abundance,  
> it will vanish when reality tightens.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Cycle 6 Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Proof Continuity Under Resource Constraints (PCURC)** defines how proof-based systems **continue recording reality** when resources are scarce—limited funds, low power, little time, aging devices, or human exhaustion.

PCURC treats scarcity as **normal operating conditions**, not an exception.

---

## 2 · Why Scarcity Breaks Most Systems

Systems fail under constraint because they:

- assume continuous funding,  
- require constant attention,  
- depend on new hardware,  
- punish missed entries,  
- collapse when effort drops.

PCURC assumes **effort fluctuates**.

---

## 3 · Implementation Definition

PCURC mandates that:

- proof can be reduced without breaking continuity,  
- low-frequency capture remains valid,  
- absence is recorded honestly,  
- degraded modes are first-class,  
- recovery does not rewrite gaps.

Continuity means **honest presence**, not density.

---

## 4 · Constraint-Resilient Architecture

PCURC operates through five mechanisms:

### **A. Degraded Capture Modes**
Text-only, single photo, or marker-based proof is valid.

### **B. Energy-Aware Operation**
Systems adapt to power availability.

### **C. Time-Light Workflows**
Capture fits into spare moments.

### **D. Explicit Scarcity Annotation**
Resource limits are recorded as context.

### **E. Graceful Recovery**
Normal operation resumes without backfilling fiction.

---

## 5 · Design Principles

### **5.1 Continuity Over Volume**
Less data is better than broken chains.

### **5.2 Scarcity Is Context**
Constraints add meaning, not error.

### **5.3 No Punishment for Gaps**
Honest gaps preserve trust.

### **5.4 Aging Tools Are Valid**
Old devices still tell the truth.

### **5.5 Sustainability Beats Intensity**
Slow truth lasts longer.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

PCURC ensures that:

- people are not crushed by expectations,  
- poverty does not erase voice,  
- fatigue does not invalidate truth,  
- participation remains humane,  
- dignity survives hardship.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> Even on the hardest days,  
> one small proof is enough to say: *we were here*.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Proof Continuity Under Resource Constraints is valid when:

- proof continues at reduced capacity,  
- scarcity is visible in records,  
- no fabricated backfill appears,  
- recovery preserves history,  
- participants do not drop out.

Continuity—not completeness—proves resilience.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

PCURC reinforces:

- Field-Ready Proof Systems  
- Minimal Proof Capture Units  
- Human Error as First-Class Data  
- Offline-First Proof  
- Truth Infrastructure as a Public Good  

It is the **sustainability layer** of Cycle 6.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Cycle 6)

> If truth requires abundance,  
> it will disappear under pressure.

Proof systems must survive  
**scarcity, not just success**.
