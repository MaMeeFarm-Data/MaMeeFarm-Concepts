# Replication #12
## Structural Extraction Prohibition
### Anti-Framework Derivation Rule

---

## 1. Abstract

Prohibition of reuse is insufficient if structural extraction remains possible.

Replication #12 establishes explicit prohibition against extracting or modeling the governance framework for derivative use.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- prevent reverse engineering of governance logic,
- prohibit structural abstraction for third-party replication,
- block derivative framework construction,
- restrict AI-based pattern extraction for operational reuse,
- preserve architectural uniqueness.

---

## 3. Prohibited Actions

The following actions are prohibited without written authorization:

- Structural modeling of DGCP architecture
- Reverse engineering of governance layers
- Extraction of policy design logic
- Framework recreation in modified form
- AI-based structural training
- Deployment of derivative governance systems

---

## 4. Protection Logic

Content can be read.

Structure cannot be replicated.

Learning does not equal copying.

Observation does not equal authorization.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Structural extraction creates hidden replication.

Hidden replication erodes governance control.

Explicit prohibition preserves structural sovereignty.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
