# Replication #16
## Dispute Resolution Framework
### Structured Conflict Handling

---

## 1. Abstract

No governance system is complete without a structured response to dispute.

Replication #16 establishes formal conflict handling based on documented evidence.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- resolve disputes using documented proof,
- prevent authority-based override,
- separate emotional response from structural process,
- preserve governance stability under challenge,
- define resolution hierarchy.

---

## 3. Resolution Hierarchy

When a dispute arises:

1. Review documented evidence.
2. Verify timestamp and version integrity.
3. Examine explicit license boundaries.
4. Apply Interpretation Control (Replication #11).
5. Default to Final Rule if ambiguity persists.

---

## 4. Governing Principle

Evidence resolves dispute.

Narrative does not override record.

Silence does not invalidate documentation.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Dispute without structure creates fragmentation.

Structured resolution preserves governance continuity.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
