# Replication #19
## Authority & Signature Control
### Delegated Governance Boundary

---

## 1. Abstract

Governance stability requires clear authority boundaries.

Replication #19 formalizes signature control and delegation limits within DGCP™ architecture.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- define who may authorize structural change,
- prevent unauthorized governance action,
- separate operational execution from structural authority,
- control delegation scope,
- preserve hierarchical clarity.

---

## 3. Authority Rules

1. Foundational authority remains with the System Architect.
2. Delegation must be explicit and documented.
3. No implied delegation exists.
4. Signature authority cannot be inferred from role visibility.
5. Structural amendments require formal written authorization.

---

## 4. Delegation Boundary

Execution authority ≠ structural authority.

Operational assistance ≠ governance amendment power.

Documentation support ≠ signature authority.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Unclear authority creates structural fragmentation.

Defined delegation preserves governance coherence.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
