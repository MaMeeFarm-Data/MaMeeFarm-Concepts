# Replication #11
## Interpretation Control
### Anti-Expansion Principle

---

## 1. Abstract

License scope clarity is insufficient without interpretation control.

This replication layer prevents expansion of rights through reinterpretation of language, silence, or contextual inference.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- prohibit rights expansion through implication,
- prevent contextual reinterpretation of restricted clauses,
- formalize that silence does not grant permission,
- eliminate inferred authorization,
- reinforce structural boundary stability.

---

## 3. Interpretation Rules

1. Silence does not imply permission.
2. Ambiguity does not expand rights.
3. Context does not override explicit restriction.
4. Study rights do not imply structural reuse rights.
5. Citation rights do not imply deployment rights.

---

## 4. Anti-Expansion Principle

Any attempt to interpret the license beyond its explicit wording is invalid unless formally amended in writing.

No derivative interpretation creates new rights.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Interpretation drift creates scope expansion.

Scope expansion creates structural instability.

Interpretation control preserves structural integrity.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
