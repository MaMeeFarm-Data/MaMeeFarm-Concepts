# Replication #17
## Continuity Under Stress
### No-Retroactive-Change Protocol

---

## 1. Abstract

Under stress, systems tend to rewrite history.

DGCP™ stability requires a strict no-retroactive-change protocol to preserve chronological integrity.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- prevent retroactive edits under pressure,
- preserve audit trust across time,
- ensure disputes do not trigger history rewriting,
- maintain integrity when external attention increases,
- formalize correction without rewriting.

---

## 3. Protocol Rules

1. Past records are not rewritten.
2. Corrections are appended as new records.
3. Amendments reference prior entries explicitly.
4. Evidence is preserved in chronological order.
5. Pressure does not change governance rules.

---

## 4. Correction Method

If an error is discovered:

- create a new entry documenting correction,
- reference the prior record,
- preserve original content unchanged,
- maintain version trace.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Retroactive change breaks trust.

Append-only correction preserves integrity.

Continuity under stress is achieved by structure, not reaction.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
