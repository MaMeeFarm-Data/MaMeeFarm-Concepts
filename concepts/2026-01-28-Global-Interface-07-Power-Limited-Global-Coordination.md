# 🧩 Global Interface #7: Power-Limited Global Coordination  
### *Coordinating Across the World Without Central Command or Authority Accumulation*

> “Coordination fails when power concentrates.  
> It succeeds when power is structurally limited.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Phase C Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Power-Limited Global Coordination (PLGC)** defines how proof-based systems enable **world-scale coordination**—responses, learning, alignment of action—**without creating centralized command, hierarchy, or authority accumulation**.

PLGC separates **coordination capacity** from **control power**.

---

## 2 · Why Global Coordination Becomes Dangerous

Global coordination mechanisms often become harmful because they:

- centralize decision authority,  
- reward speed over accuracy,  
- collapse diversity into directives,  
- convert coordination into governance,  
- accumulate irreversible power.

PLGC treats **power accumulation as a system failure**, not a trade-off.

---

## 3 · Interface Definition

PLGC mandates that:

- coordination signals are derived from proof,  
- no actor can issue binding global commands,  
- participation remains voluntary and local,  
- coordination outcomes are advisory, not coercive,  
- withdrawal does not collapse the system.

The system coordinates **without commanding**.

---

## 4 · Coordination Architecture

PLGC operates through five components:

### **A. Proof-Triggered Signals**
Coordination begins from evidence, not orders.

### **B. Distributed Aggregation**
Insights emerge from many sites without a center.

### **C. Non-Binding Outputs**
Recommendations do not become mandates.

### **D. Local Execution Autonomy**
Each site decides how—or whether—to act.

### **E. Power Decay Mechanisms**
Temporary influence expires by design.

---

## 5 · Coordination Principles

### **5.1 No Central Command**
There is no global controller.

### **5.2 Evidence-Driven Synchronization**
Shared proof aligns action timing.

### **5.3 Voluntary Participation**
Actors opt in and out freely.

### **5.4 Reversibility**
Coordination paths can be abandoned.

### **5.5 Anti-Accumulation**
Influence cannot be stored or inherited.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

PLGC ensures that:

- local actors are not overridden,  
- speed does not silence caution,  
- minorities are not outvoted by scale,  
- coordination does not become domination,  
- dignity survives urgency.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> We may act together.  
> We are never commanded.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Power-Limited Global Coordination is valid when:

- no actor can compel global action,  
- coordination persists after withdrawals,  
- evidence remains the trigger,  
- diversity of response is visible,  
- power does not compound over time.

Coordination must scale  
**without concentrating authority**.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

PLGC reinforces:

- Proof-as-Interface  
- Global Scale Without Cultural Erasure  
- Interoperability Without Data Surrender  
- Federation Without Centralization  
- Exit, Fork, and Continuity Rights  

It is the **coordination layer** of Phase C.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Phase C)

> If coordination creates rulers,  
> the interface is corrupt.

Global coordination must remain  
**power-limited by design**.
