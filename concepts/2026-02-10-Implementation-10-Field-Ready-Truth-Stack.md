# 🧩 Implementation #10: Field-Ready Truth Stack  
### *Assembling a Complete, Deployable Proof System for Real-World Use*

> “A system is complete  
> when no one needs permission to use it.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Cycle 6 Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Field-Ready Truth Stack (FRTS)** defines the **complete assembly** of all Cycle 6 components into a deployable system that enables **ordinary people in ordinary conditions** to capture, preserve, verify, and compose truth—without expertise, authority, or ideal infrastructure.

Cycle 6 ends when truth **stands on its own feet**.

---

## 2 · Stack Overview

The Field-Ready Truth Stack consists of ten integrated layers:

1. **Field-Ready Proof Systems**  
2. **Offline-First Proof & Delayed Trust Anchoring**  
3. **Minimal Proof Capture Units (MPUs)**  
4. **Human Error as First-Class Data**  
5. **Proof Continuity Under Resource Constraints**  
6. **Verification Without Expertise**  
7. **Traceability Without Surveillance**  
8. **Composable Proof Chains**  
9. **Long-Term Proof Preservation & Drift Resistance**  
10. **Field-Ready Truth Stack (Closure)**

Each layer functions independently  
yet strengthens the others.

---

## 3 · What “Field-Ready” Means

A truth system is field-ready when:

- it works with poor connectivity,  
- it tolerates human error,  
- it survives resource scarcity,  
- it can be verified by anyone,  
- it protects privacy,  
- it scales without central control,  
- it remains meaningful over time.

If any condition fails,  
the stack is not complete.

---

## 4 · Deployment Characteristics

FRTS enables deployment in:

- farms and households,  
- workshops and classrooms,  
- disaster zones,  
- informal economies,  
- communities without institutions,  
- long-term civil records.

No environment is “too small”  
to produce valid truth.

---

## 5 · Non-Requirements (By Design)

The Field-Ready Truth Stack does **not** require:

- continuous internet access,  
- expert operators,  
- centralized platforms,  
- trusted authorities,  
- perfect data,  
- surveillance,  
- permission.

Truth becomes **infrastructure**, not service.

---

## 6 · Governance Boundary

This stack intentionally:

- removes founder authority,  
- prevents institutional capture,  
- resists narrative control,  
- separates proof from power,  
- allows multiple interpretations.

> This playbook intentionally removes founder authority.  
> Any future interpretation must rely on proof, not origin.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

The Field-Ready Truth Stack is valid when:

- people keep using it without coercion,  
- proof continues during hardship,  
- verification remains accessible,  
- no actor can dominate truth,  
- the system outlives its creators.

Adoption without dependency  
signals completion.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

FRTS fulfills:

- Truth Infrastructure as a Public Good  
- Proof-as-Interface  
- Distributed Human Sovereignty  
- Global Accountability Without Government  
- Intergenerational Proof Continuity  

Cycle 6 completes the **operational layer** of DGCP.

---

## 9 · Cycle 6 Closing Statement

Cycle 6 proves that:

- truth can be recorded anywhere,  
- truth can be verified by anyone,  
- truth can survive scarcity,  
- truth can scale without domination,  
- truth does not need permission.

The system is ready.
