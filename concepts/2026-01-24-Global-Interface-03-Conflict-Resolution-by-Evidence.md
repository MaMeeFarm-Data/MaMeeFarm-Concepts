# ⚖️ Global Interface #3: Conflict Resolution by Evidence, Not Power  
### *Resolving Disputes Through Verifiable Proof Rather Than Authority or Force*

> “Power ends arguments.  
> Evidence ends disagreement.”

## 1 · Abstract

**Conflict Resolution by Evidence, Not Power (CRENP)** defines a global interface where disputes are resolved through **verifiable proof and transparent inspection**, not through hierarchy, authority, negotiation leverage, or force.

CRENP does not eliminate conflict.  
It **prevents conflict from destroying truth**.

---

## 2 · Why Power-Based Resolution Fails

Traditional dispute resolution fails because it:

- privileges authority over accuracy,  
- rewards influence instead of evidence,  
- escalates through coercion,  
- suppresses minority positions,  
- freezes narratives rather than correcting them.

CRENP replaces these dynamics with **evidence-first adjudication**.

---

## 3 · Interface Definition

CRENP mandates that:

- all claims in dispute reference inspectable proof,  
- authority cannot override evidence,  
- absence of proof is explicit, not hidden,  
- disagreement is allowed without punishment,  
- resolution remains reversible if new proof appears.

Truth remains **open to correction**.

---

## 4 · Resolution Architecture

CRENP operates through five components:

### **A. Claim–Proof Binding**
Every claim must link to evidence.

### **B. Independent Verification Paths**
Each party verifies autonomously.

### **C. Transparent Disagreement Records**
Unresolved disputes remain visible.

### **D. Non-Coercive Outcomes**
No forced compliance without proof.

### **E. Update-on-New-Evidence**
Resolutions evolve as proof evolves.

---

## 5 · Resolution Principles

### **5.1 Evidence Over Authority**
Titles and power do not decide truth.

### **5.2 Disagreement Is Legitimate**
Lack of consensus is not failure.

### **5.3 No Finality Without Proof**
Nothing is “settled” by decree.

### **5.4 Minority Evidence Protection**
Small or unpopular proofs remain visible.

### **5.5 Reversibility**
New evidence can reopen resolution.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

CRENP ensures that:

- weaker actors are not silenced,  
- disputes do not require confrontation,  
- truth is not hostage to politics,  
- participation remains dignified,  
- conflict does not erase contribution.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> Even if no one agrees with us,  
> the proof still stands.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Conflict Resolution by Evidence is valid when:

- disputes reference proofs consistently,  
- authority cannot suppress evidence,  
- unresolved disagreements remain inspectable,  
- outcomes adapt to new proof,  
- no coercion replaces verification.

Evidence—not victory—validates resolution.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

CRENP reinforces:

- Proof-as-Interface  
- Multi-Cultural Interpretability Without Alignment  
- Cross-Site Trust & Verification  
- Institutional Readiness Without Capture  
- Civilizational Memory Ledger  

It is the **conflict-handling layer** of Phase C.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Phase C)

> If a dispute is resolved without evidence,  
> the system has failed.

Conflict must be processed  
by **proof, not power**.
