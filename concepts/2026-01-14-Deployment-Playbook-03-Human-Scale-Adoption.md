# 🌱 Deployment Playbook #3: Human-Scale Adoption  
### *Growing Proof-Based Systems at the Pace Humans Can Sustain*

> “Systems that outgrow humans  
> eventually consume them.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Phase B Notes

---

## 1 · Abstract

**Human-Scale Adoption (HSA)** defines how proof-based systems expand **only at a pace humans can sustain**—physically, cognitively, and emotionally—over the long term.

HSA rejects:
- aggressive onboarding targets,  
- forced daily quotas,  
- exponential growth mandates,  
- compliance-driven participation.

Instead, it prioritizes **continuity over speed**.

---

## 2 · Why Adoption Breaks People

Most deployments fail because they:

- equate adoption with compliance,  
- ignore fatigue and cognitive load,  
- reward volume over consistency,  
- treat humans as throughput,  
- confuse short-term uptake with success.

HSA treats humans as **the limiting factor to respect**, not a bottleneck to remove.

---

## 3 · Playbook Definition

Human-Scale Adoption mandates that:

- participation remains voluntary at all stages,  
- workload increases only after stability,  
- drop-offs are acceptable and visible,  
- rest and pauses are valid states,  
- no penalties exist for slower rhythms.

Adoption becomes **inhabitable**, not extractive.

---

## 4 · Adoption Rhythms

HSA recognizes natural human rhythms:

- daily variability in energy,  
- weekly fluctuation in capacity,  
- seasonal changes in workload,  
- life events and interruptions,  
- aging and health constraints.

The system adapts to rhythm—  
**humans do not adapt to dashboards**.

---

## 5 · Growth Principles

### **5.1 Consistency Over Volume**
One proof per day for a year beats ten per day for a week.

### **5.2 Opt-In Expansion**
New practices are adopted by choice, not mandate.

### **5.3 Pause Is Not Failure**
Rest periods are valid operational states.

### **5.4 Learning Before Scaling**
Understanding precedes expansion.

### **5.5 Burnout Is a System Bug**
If humans burn out, the design is wrong.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

HSA ensures that:

- participation remains humane,  
- dignity is preserved under slow progress,  
- effort is valued even when minimal,  
- long-term contributors are protected,  
- systems remain livable.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> Some days produce one proof.  
> Some days produce none.  
> The system still works.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Human-Scale Adoption is valid when:

- participants remain active over months,  
- workload feels manageable,  
- pauses do not break continuity,  
- no external pressure is required,  
- truth quality remains high.

Longevity, not velocity, validates adoption.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

HSA reinforces:

- Failure Visibility & Anti-Gaming Design  
- Long-Term Integrity & Drift Resistance  
- Constraint-Aware Evaluation  
- Minimal Viable Deployment  
- Human-Centered Outcome Aggregation  

It is the **sustainability layer** of Phase B.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Phase B)

> Growth that humans cannot sustain  
> is not adoption — it is extraction.

Systems must fit human life  
or they will eventually collapse.
