# Replication #18
## Release Governance
### Controlled Disclosure Protocol

---

## 1. Abstract

Publication without boundary control creates structural exposure.

Replication #18 formalizes controlled disclosure within the DGCP™ governance architecture.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- regulate publication scope,
- prevent accidental exposure of operational logic,
- separate public documentation from internal governance structure,
- preserve intellectual containment,
- maintain disclosure discipline.

---

## 3. Controlled Disclosure Rules

1. Public content must not expose internal structural logic beyond defined scope.
2. Operational procedures remain internal unless formally released.
3. License language must remain consistent across all disclosures.
4. Publication timing must follow governance review.
5. Sensitive implementation details are excluded from public release.

---

## 4. Governance Logic

Transparency does not require full exposure.

Visibility does not equal operational access.

Controlled release preserves structural sovereignty.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Overexposure weakens control.

Controlled disclosure preserves long-term governance stability.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
