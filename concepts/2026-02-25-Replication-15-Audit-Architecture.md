# Replication #15
## Audit Architecture
### Independent Verification Readiness

---

## 1. Abstract

Proof without audit readiness limits structural credibility.

Replication #15 establishes an audit-capable architecture that allows independent verification without surrendering governance control.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- enable third-party verification of documented records,
- preserve structural transparency,
- separate audit access from structural ownership,
- prevent centralization of trust,
- reinforce credibility without exposing proprietary logic.

---

## 3. Core Architecture

Audit architecture requires:

1. Timestamped documentation.
2. Version-tracked evolution.
3. Immutable record anchoring.
4. Clear scope boundaries.
5. Separation between verification rights and replication rights.

---

## 4. Governance Logic

Audit does not equal reuse.

Verification does not equal ownership.

Observation does not equal authorization.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Transparent systems endure scrutiny.

Opaque systems erode trust.

Audit readiness preserves structural legitimacy.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
