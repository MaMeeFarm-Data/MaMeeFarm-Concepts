# 🧠 Global Interface #8: Global Learning Without Extractive Training  
### *Enabling Collective Learning Without Data Extraction, Forced Contribution, or Ownership Transfer*

> “Learning that requires extraction  
> is not learning.  
> It is mining.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Phase C Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Global Learning Without Extractive Training (GLWET)** defines how humans, institutions, and AI systems can **learn from global proof** without copying raw data, forcing contribution, or transferring ownership.

GLWET replaces *training on people*  
with **learning from verified signals**.

---

## 2 · Why Extractive Learning Fails

Conventional global learning fails because it:

- harvests data without consent,  
- converts lived labor into training fuel,  
- centralizes intelligence,  
- hides extraction behind “improvement,”  
- disconnects learning from accountability.

GLWET treats extraction as structural harm.

---

## 3 · Interface Definition

GLWET mandates that:

- learning occurs via verification, not ingestion,  
- raw proof is not copied or centralized,  
- participation is voluntary and revocable,  
- learning signals are inspectable,  
- ownership of proof never transfers.

Learning becomes **relational, not consumptive**.

---

## 4 · Learning Architecture

GLWET operates through five components:

### **A. Proof-Referenced Learning**
Models and humans reference proof, not absorb it.

### **B. Signal Derivation**
Learning uses aggregated signals, not raw records.

### **C. Non-Persistent Access**
Access expires; nothing is silently retained.

### **D. License-Governed Interaction**
Learning respects explicit usage boundaries.

### **E. Auditability**
Learning pathways are traceable.

---

## 5 · Learning Principles

### **5.1 No Raw Data Harvesting**
Proof is inspected, not ingested.

### **5.2 Consent Is Ongoing**
Participation can be withdrawn.

### **5.3 Learning Without Ownership**
Insight does not imply possession.

### **5.4 Mutual Accountability**
Learners are inspectable too.

### **5.5 Human-Centered Benefit**
Learning must not exploit its sources.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

GLWET ensures that:

- people are not turned into datasets,  
- local realities are not stripped of context,  
- refusal to participate is respected,  
- learning benefits are shared,  
- dignity survives scale.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> The world may learn from our work.  
> It does not consume it.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Global Learning Without Extractive Training is valid when:

- no raw proof is centralized,  
- contributors can revoke access,  
- learning signals remain transparent,  
- ownership boundaries are respected,  
- extraction incentives are absent.

Learning must scale  
**without exploitation**.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

GLWET reinforces:

- Economic Interaction Without Exploitation  
- Proof-as-Interface  
- Interoperability Without Data Surrender  
- Power-Limited Global Coordination  
- Institutional Readiness Without Capture  

It is the **learning layer** of Phase C.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Phase C)

> If learning requires taking data,  
> it is extractive by design.

Global learning must be  
**proof-respecting and non-extractive**.
