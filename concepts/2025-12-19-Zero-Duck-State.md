# Zero Duck State — No Ducks Remain at MaMeeFarm

Date: 2025-12-19  
Location: MaMeeFarm, Lampang, Thailand  
System State: ZERO_DUCK_STATE (Critical)

## 1) Definition
**Zero Duck State** is a verifiable operational condition in which **no ducks remain** as active living agents at MaMeeFarm—neither in the coop nor in the field—resulting in a temporary suspension of duck-origin ground-truth signals (eggs, duck behavior, duck health observations) from the farm.

This is a **factual system condition**, not a narrative framing.

## 2) Context & Trigger
MaMeeFarm began with an initial living data source of **seven ducks**.  
As of the stated date, real-life events have led to **complete depletion**, and the duck subsystem enters **zero-state**.

## 3) Why This Matters (Protocol-Level Significance)
A “Zero Duck State” is important because it:
- **Prevents ambiguous storytelling**: the system explicitly records a negative state (“none exist”) instead of remaining silent.
- **Protects integrity of traceability**: the dataset remains consistent—absence is also a truth that must be logged.
- **Maintains continuity of DGCP evidence**: proofs can continue for other subsystems (dogs, crops, water, power, operations) without implying duck activity.

## 4) Operational Implications
When the system is in ZERO_DUCK_STATE:
- Duck outputs must be treated as **null**:
  - Eggs = 0 (not “missing”, not “unknown”)
  - Duck feeding / duck health checks = **not applicable**
- Farm proofs may continue under other categories:
  - Water constraints, irrigation, crops, energy, logistics, dog care, human operations, governance updates.
- Any future duck reintroduction becomes a **state transition event**:
  - ZERO_DUCK_STATE → DUCK_REINTRODUCED (with a verifiable first-proof boundary)

## 5) Evidence Anchor (Primary Reference)
This concept is anchored to the issue log that records the critical system state:
- `Issues/2025-12-19-duck-depletion-zero-state.md`  
(Repo: IPFS-Proof / Proof-Issues as shown in the reference screenshot)

## 6) Activity Classification
- Domain: Farm Operations / Ground Truth Integrity
- Type: System State Declaration
- Severity: Critical
- Verifiability: Documentary Evidence (issue log) + ongoing daily proofs

## 7) Forward Compatibility
This concept is designed to be reusable for any verifiable “absence state” (eg. Zero Water State, Zero Power State) where **explicit negative truth** is required for auditability.
