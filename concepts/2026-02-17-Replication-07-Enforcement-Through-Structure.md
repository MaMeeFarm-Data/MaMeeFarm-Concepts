# Replication #7
## Enforcement Through Structure
### Stability Without Founder Authority

---

## 1. Abstract

This document defines Replication #7: Enforcement Through Structure.

The objective is to ensure that enforcement is embedded in architecture, not dependent on founder authority.
Replication remains stable only when restrictions and permissions are structurally explicit.

---

## 2. Purpose

This replication layer exists to:

- preserve governance continuity without central authority,
- maintain stable boundaries between study and operational use,
- define enforcement before any commercial activation,
- prevent implied license interpretation,
- ensure structural clarity that survives scale.

---

## 3. Enforcement Principles

Enforcement is treated as system structure, not social authority.

Core mechanisms:

1. Restricted license declaration at schema level.
2. Repository-level notice anchoring.
3. Tiered usage model (pre-activation definition).
4. Explicit prohibition of operational implementation without permission.
5. Foundational-year protection (© 2025).
6. No implied license rule.

---

## 4. Replication Logic

If enforcement depends on personality, the system weakens under scale.

If enforcement is embedded in structure, replication remains stable.

This layer formalizes that stability condition.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Authority may change.  
Structure must remain.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Study and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires a paid license agreement and written authorization.
