# 🔐 The Consent-Propagation Protocol  
### *Ensuring Continuous, Revocable, and Enforceable Human Consent Across Distributed Systems*

> “Consent is not a checkbox.  
> It is a living decision that must travel with the data.”

# 1 · Abstract

The **Consent-Propagation Protocol (CPP)** is a DGCP framework that guarantees **human consent remains active, visible, and enforceable** as data moves across:

- platforms,  
- AI systems,  
- national boundaries,  
- time horizons,  
- and derivative uses.

Unlike traditional consent models—static, one-time, and easily ignored—CPP treats consent as a **continuous state** that must propagate wherever the data goes.

---

# 2 · Purpose

CPP exists to:

- prevent consent decay over time,  
- allow humans to revoke or modify consent dynamically,  
- ensure downstream systems inherit consent constraints,  
- block unauthorized secondary use,  
- make consent violations detectable and enforceable.

It converts consent from a *legal fiction* into a *technical reality*.

---

# 3 · The Consent Failure Problem

Modern systems fail consent because:

- consent is captured once, then forgotten,  
- data is copied without carrying permissions,  
- downstream AI systems ignore original intent,  
- revocation is impractical or impossible,  
- humans lose control after initial sharing.

CPP is designed to eliminate these failures.

---

# 4 · Protocol Architecture

The Consent-Propagation Protocol consists of four layers:

## **A. Consent Declaration Layer**
Humans define permissions, scope, duration, and conditions.

## **B. Consent Binding Layer**
Consent is cryptographically bound to the data and its derivatives.

## **C. Consent Transmission Layer**
Every data transfer carries consent metadata forward.

## **D. Consent Enforcement Layer**
Receiving systems must verify consent before any use.

Together, these layers ensure consent **travels with the data**.

---

# 5 · Enforcement Mechanisms

### **5.1 Dynamic Consent Tokens**
Consent is represented as updatable tokens, not static records.

### **5.2 Downstream Permission Inheritance**
Derived datasets inherit the strictest consent constraints.

### **5.3 Revocation Propagation**
When consent is withdrawn, revocation signals cascade globally.

### **5.4 AI Consent Compliance**
AI models must respect consent boundaries during training and inference.

### **5.5 Violation Auditing**
Unauthorized use creates detectable consent breach events.

---

# 6 · Human-First Impact

CPP ensures that:

- humans can change their minds without penalty,  
- consent remains meaningful over time,  
- data dignity survives system expansion,  
- participation never becomes irreversible,  
- trust becomes enforceable, not symbolic.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> You can say “yes,” “no,” or “not anymore” —  
> and the entire system must obey.

---

# 7 · DGCP Alignment

CPP integrates with:

- Freedom-of-Context Protocol  
- Zero-Domination Data Model  
- Sovereign Proof Chain  
- Identity-Integrity Continuum  
- Cross-AI Ethical Defense Layer  

It is the **decision-control layer** of Distributed Human Sovereignty.

---

# 8 · Future Implications

### For AI  
Training and inference become consent-aware by design.

### For Platforms  
Unauthorized secondary use becomes technically impossible.

### For Governance  
Consent violations become auditable and enforceable.

### For Civilization  
Human choice regains real power in digital life.
