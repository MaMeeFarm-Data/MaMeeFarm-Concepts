# 🔗 Deployment Playbook #6: Interoperability Without Data Surrender  
### *Connecting With External Systems While Preserving Proof Sovereignty*

> “Integration should extend reach,  
> not transfer ownership.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Phase B Notes

---

## 1 · Abstract

**Interoperability Without Data Surrender (IWDS)** defines how proof-based systems **interact with external platforms, institutions, and standards** without relinquishing **data ownership, control, or interpretive authority**.

IWDS replaces “data sharing” with **verifiable reference and inspection**.

---

## 2 · Why Integration Usually Becomes Extraction

Most integrations fail because they:

- require raw data ingestion,  
- centralize interpretation externally,  
- impose foreign schemas,  
- break provenance chains,  
- convert cooperation into dependency.

IWDS is designed to prevent all five.

---

## 3 · Playbook Definition

IWDS mandates that:

- proofs remain at origin,  
- external systems reference proofs, not copy them,  
- verification occurs through open interfaces,  
- schemas map without rewriting meaning,  
- termination of integration leaves proof intact.

Integration becomes **non-destructive**.

---

## 4 · Interoperability Mechanisms

IWDS relies on five mechanisms:

### **A. Proof Reference Links**
External systems point to verifiable proofs.

### **B. Read-Only Verification Paths**
Inspection without modification rights.

### **C. Schema Mapping Layers**
Translation without semantic overwrite.

### **D. Time & Integrity Anchors**
External checks validate immutability.

### **E. Revocable Connectivity**
Links can be disabled without data loss.

---

## 5 · Integration Principles

### **5.1 Reference, Don’t Transfer**
Ownership never changes hands.

### **5.2 Verify, Don’t Import**
External actors verify independently.

### **5.3 No Interpretive Monopoly**
Meaning remains local to origin.

### **5.4 Optional Connectivity**
Integration is opt-in and reversible.

### **5.5 Exit Without Amnesia**
Disconnecting does not erase history.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

IWDS ensures that:

- participants are not coerced into data surrender,  
- local context is not flattened by global schemas,  
- cooperation does not create dependency traps,  
- institutions cannot rewrite lived reality,  
- dignity and agency are preserved.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> Governments, NGOs, or AI labs  
> can verify our proof —  
> but they do not own it.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Interoperability Without Data Surrender is valid when:

- external systems can verify without ingestion,  
- proof remains intact after disconnection,  
- provenance chains are unbroken,  
- no authority shift occurs silently,  
- integration increases reach without risk.

Access without control validates interoperability.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

IWDS reinforces:

- Proof Literacy & Local Ownership  
- Cross-Site Trust & Verification  
- Federation Without Centralization  
- Long-Term Integrity & Drift Resistance  
- Anti-Centralization Safeguard  

It is the **external interface layer** of Phase B.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Phase B)

> If integration requires data surrender,  
> it is extraction — not interoperability.

Connectivity must never  
cost ownership of truth.
