# 🧱 Deployment Playbook #2: Constraint-First Rollout  
### *Deploying Proof-Based Systems by Starting Where Reality Is Hardest*

> “If a system only works  
> where life is easy,  
> it does not work.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Phase B Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Constraint-First Rollout (CFR)** defines a deployment strategy that **intentionally begins in the most constrained environments**, not the most favorable ones.

CFR ensures that proof-based systems are:
- resilient under hardship,  
- honest under pressure,  
- usable without ideal conditions,  
- grounded in real human limits.

---

## 2 · Why Starting Easy Corrupts Systems

Deployments that start in “easy” environments fail because they:

- hide structural weaknesses,  
- assume stable resources,  
- misrepresent human effort,  
- normalize exception handling,  
- collapse when constraints appear later.

CFR reverses this failure pattern.

---

## 3 · Playbook Definition

Constraint-First Rollout mandates that:

- the first rollout site has **known, visible constraints**,  
- scarcity and friction are logged explicitly,  
- missing data is acceptable and recorded,  
- work proceeds without workaround masking,  
- success is not required for validity.

The system must survive **reality as it is**.

---

## 4 · Constraint Categories

CFR explicitly recognizes constraints such as:

- time scarcity  
- energy or power instability  
- limited tools or infrastructure  
- physical fatigue or aging labor  
- environmental volatility  
- knowledge or skill gaps  

Constraints are **first-class data**, not noise.

---

## 5 · Deployment Principles

### **5.1 Hard First, Easy Later**
If it works here, it will work elsewhere.

### **5.2 No Constraint Compensation**
Do not “fix” reality to help the system.

### **5.3 Explicit Limitation Logging**
What cannot be done is part of the proof.

### **5.4 Survival Over Optimization**
Continuation matters more than efficiency.

### **5.5 No Success Bias**
Failure under constraint is valid deployment.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

CFR ensures that:

- participants are not blamed for hardship,  
- effort is valued even without output,  
- constraints are not treated as incompetence,  
- dignity is preserved under scarcity,  
- truth survives discomfort.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> Limited power, aging labor, bad weather —  
> the system does not pause.  
> It records.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

A Constraint-First Rollout is valid when:

- constraints are visible in proof,  
- work proceeds without artificial smoothing,  
- system remains usable under friction,  
- failure is captured without shame,  
- no idealization is introduced.

Reality, not success, validates deployment.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

CFR activates:

- Constraint-Aware Evaluation  
- Failure Visibility & Anti-Gaming Design  
- Proof-First Implementation Principle  
- Long-Term Integrity & Drift Resistance  
- Human-Centered Outcome Aggregation  

It is the **stress-test layer** of Phase B.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Phase B)

> If deployment avoids hardship,  
> it is rehearsing — not deploying.

Only systems that survive constraints  
deserve to scale.
