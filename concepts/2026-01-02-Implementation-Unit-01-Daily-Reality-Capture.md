# 🧩 Implementation Unit #1: Daily Reality Capture  
### *Turning Everyday Human Work into Verifiable System Input*

> “Implementation does not begin with a project.  
> It begins with what people already do.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Cycle 5 Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Daily Reality Capture (DRC)** is the first executable implementation unit of Cycle 5.  
It converts **ordinary human activity** into **verifiable, time-anchored system input** without altering how people live or work.

DRC treats reality as the primary data source — not reports, dashboards, or narratives.

---

## 2 · Why Daily Capture Is the First Unit

Implementation fails when systems demand:
- special workflows,
- artificial pilots,
- ideal conditions,
- trained intermediaries,
- delayed reporting.

DRC succeeds because:
- it uses existing daily behavior,
- it captures reality as-is,
- it requires minimal abstraction,
- it works under constraint,
- it scales naturally.

---

## 3 · Unit Definition

Daily Reality Capture mandates that:

- **every day produces at least one proof**,  
- proof is captured at the moment of action,  
- capture does not interrupt real work,  
- context is preserved, not summarized,  
- nothing is “too small” to record.

Reality becomes **continuous system input**.

---

## 4 · Capture Scope

DRC applies to:

- physical labor (feeding, repairing, cleaning),  
- decision-making (choosing, postponing, prioritizing),  
- environmental conditions (weather, temperature, scarcity),  
- constraints (lack of money, tools, time),  
- outcomes (success, failure, interruption).

No filtering. No curation.

---

## 5 · Proof Structure

Each Daily Reality Capture includes:

- **Time Anchor** — when it occurred  
- **Origin Anchor** — where it occurred  
- **Human Anchor** — who acted  
- **Context Anchor** — under what conditions  
- **Evidence Artifact** — photo, log, sensor, or trace  

This structure ensures auditability without bureaucracy.

---

## 6 · Human-First Design

DRC is designed so that:

- humans are not forced into “data work”,  
- capture follows life, not the reverse,  
- imperfection is acceptable and expected,  
- gaps are recorded, not hidden,  
- honesty outranks completeness.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> A day with broken equipment  
> is as valuable as a day of success —  
> because both are real.

---

## 7 · System Effects

When DRC is enforced:

- implementation becomes unavoidable,  
- reality outruns narrative manipulation,  
- small actors generate high-value data,  
- long-term patterns emerge organically,  
- trust accumulates through visibility.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

Daily Reality Capture anchors:

- DGCP Proof System  
- Daily Logs & OTS Anchoring  
- Civilizational Memory Ledger  
- Proof-First Implementation Principle  
- Human Sovereignty Execution Layer  

It is the **atomic unit of real-world deployment**.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Cycle 5)

> If a day passes without capture,  
> the system has no right to speak for that day.

Implementation begins **today**,  
and continues **every day**.
