# 🧮 Implementation Unit #5: Human-Centered Outcome Aggregation  
### *Aggregating Results Across Time and Actors Without Erasing Individual Reality*

## 1 · Abstract

**Human-Centered Outcome Aggregation (HCOA)** is the fifth implementation unit of Cycle 5.  
It enables systems to **combine outcomes across days, actors, and contexts** while **preserving individual proof, constraints, and meaning**.

HCOA rejects aggregation methods that flatten reality into averages or rankings detached from lived conditions.

---

## 2 · Why Aggregation Usually Fails

Traditional aggregation fails because it:

- compresses diverse realities into single metrics,  
- hides constraint-driven effort,  
- rewards scale over survival,  
- erases minority experiences,  
- incentivizes gaming and narrative smoothing.

HCOA replaces these failures with **context-preserving synthesis**.

---

## 3 · Unit Definition

HCOA mandates that:

- aggregation never replaces underlying proof,  
- individual context remains inspectable,  
- summaries link back to source evidence,  
- comparison respects constraint ranges,  
- uncertainty is visible, not hidden.

The system summarizes **without silencing**.

---

## 4 · Aggregation Structure

Each aggregated view includes:

- **Population Scope** (who/what is included)  
- **Time Window** (explicit and bounded)  
- **Outcome Dimensions** (what is measured)  
- **Constraint Bands** (contextual ranges)  
- **Drill-Down Links** (to individual proofs)

Aggregation becomes **navigable, not final**.

---

## 5 · Aggregation Principles

### **5.1 No Single-Score Reduction**
Multiple dimensions coexist.

### **5.2 Constraint-Weighted Interpretation**
Outcomes are read within feasible bands.

### **5.3 Minority Signal Preservation**
Outliers are signals, not noise.

### **5.4 Reversible Views**
Aggregates can always be decomposed.

### **5.5 Proof Sovereignty**
Source proofs remain authoritative.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

HCOA ensures that:

- small contributors remain visible,  
- effort under hardship is not erased,  
- averages do not become moral judgments,  
- comparison does not become punishment,  
- learning remains humane.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> One difficult day  
> is not lost inside a monthly average —  
> it remains part of the truth.

---

## 7 · System Effects

With HCOA active:

- decision-making improves without injustice,  
- policy analysis reflects lived reality,  
- AI learns from diverse conditions,  
- optimization avoids harming the vulnerable,  
- trust survives scale.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

HCOA integrates with:

- Constraint-Aware Evaluation  
- Proof Linking & Causal Chains  
- Distributed Accountability Mesh  
- Regenerative Governance Loop  
- Civilizational Memory Ledger  

It is the **synthesis layer** of Cycle 5.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Cycle 5)

> Aggregation may summarize,  
> but **it must never overwrite reality**.

If a summary cannot point back to proof,  
it does not belong in the system.
