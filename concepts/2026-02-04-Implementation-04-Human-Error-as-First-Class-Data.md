# ⚠️ Implementation #4: Human Error as First-Class Data  
### *Treating Mistakes, Gaps, and Deviations as Verifiable Evidence, Not Noise*

> “Systems fail when they pretend  
> humans don’t make mistakes.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Cycle 6 Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Human Error as First-Class Data (HEFCD)** defines how proof-based field systems **explicitly record mistakes, omissions, delays, and deviations** as part of reality—rather than hiding, correcting, or punishing them.

HEFCD treats error as **information**, not failure.

---

## 2 · Why Error Is Usually Erased

Conventional systems erase error because they:

- optimize for clean reports,  
- punish deviation,  
- incentivize concealment,  
- rewrite history retroactively,  
- confuse accuracy with perfection.

HEFCD rejects perfection as dishonest.

---

## 3 · Implementation Definition

HEFCD mandates that:

- errors can be recorded intentionally,  
- gaps remain visible as gaps,  
- late entries are labeled, not rejected,  
- corrections create new records,  
- no penalty is attached to honesty.

Truth includes **how things went wrong**.

---

## 4 · Error Recording Architecture

HEFCD operates through five mechanisms:

### **A. Explicit Error Flags**
Mistakes are marked, not masked.

### **B. Gap Visibility**
Missing data is preserved as absence.

### **C. Late-Entry Annotation**
Delayed records are time-labeled honestly.

### **D. Non-Destructive Correction**
Fixes append; they do not overwrite.

### **E. Inspection Without Punishment**
Review does not imply blame.

---

## 5 · Design Principles

### **5.1 Honesty Over Cleanliness**
Messy truth beats polished fiction.

### **5.2 No Retroactive Perfection**
Past errors stay visible.

### **5.3 Error as Signal**
Deviation carries meaning.

### **5.4 Safety for Admission**
People must feel safe to record mistakes.

### **5.5 Learning Over Compliance**
Errors improve systems.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

HEFCD ensures that:

- tired or stressed people are protected,  
- honesty is rewarded, not punished,  
- fear does not distort records,  
- learning emerges from failure,  
- dignity survives imperfection.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> If we forget to water,  
> that fact matters more than a perfect log.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Human Error as First-Class Data is valid when:

- errors appear visibly in records,  
- corrections do not erase history,  
- late entries remain verifiable,  
- inspection does not trigger punishment,  
- people continue to report honestly.

Trust grows when error is visible.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

HEFCD reinforces:

- Minimal Proof Capture Units  
- Field-Ready Proof Systems  
- Offline-First Proof  
- Long-Term Integrity  
- Human Dignity Preservation  

It is the **honesty layer** of Cycle 6.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Cycle 6)

> If error is punished,  
> truth will be hidden.

Proof systems must make  
**honesty safer than perfection**.
