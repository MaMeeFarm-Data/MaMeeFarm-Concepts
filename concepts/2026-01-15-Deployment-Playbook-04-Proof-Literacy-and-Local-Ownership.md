# 🧠 Deployment Playbook #4: Proof Literacy & Local Ownership  
### *Ensuring Participants Understand, Verify, and Own Their Own Proof*

> “If people cannot understand their own proof,  
> they do not own it.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Phase B Notes

---

## 1 · Abstract

**Proof Literacy & Local Ownership (PLLO)** defines how participants in a proof-based system **learn to understand, verify, and control their own proofs**, without relying on intermediaries, experts, or central authorities.

PLLO transforms users from **data sources** into **evidence holders**.

---

## 2 · Why Proof Fails Without Literacy

Systems fail when:

- proof is opaque to participants,  
- verification requires specialists,  
- ownership is abstract or contractual,  
- people comply without understanding,  
- trust replaces comprehension.

PLLO eliminates blind participation.

---

## 3 · Playbook Definition

Proof Literacy & Local Ownership mandates that:

- participants can explain what their proof is,  
- verification steps are simple and local,  
- ownership is explicit and retained,  
- no proof is “submitted” without understanding,  
- exit does not forfeit ownership.

Proof becomes **legible and personal**.

---

## 4 · Levels of Proof Literacy

PLLO recognizes progressive literacy levels:

1. **Recognition** — knowing what counts as proof  
2. **Verification** — checking integrity independently  
3. **Contextualization** — understanding constraints  
4. **Linking** — seeing how proof connects over time  
5. **Assertion** — confidently standing behind one’s proof  

Advancement is **optional, not required**.

---

## 5 · Ownership Principles

### **5.1 Origin Ownership**
Proof belongs to the person or site where it was created.

### **5.2 No Forced Transfer**
Participation does not require surrendering control.

### **5.3 Verifiable Without Permission**
Anyone can verify; no one can rewrite.

### **5.4 Portable Proof**
Proof can move without losing integrity.

### **5.5 Exit With Dignity**
Leaving the system does not erase past truth.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

PLLO ensures that:

- people are not exploited as data labor,  
- understanding replaces blind trust,  
- power asymmetry is reduced,  
- local knowledge remains authoritative,  
- dignity is preserved through ownership.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> The farmer understands the proof  
> better than any dashboard ever could.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Proof Literacy & Local Ownership is valid when:

- participants can verify their own proof,  
- no external authority is needed to explain it,  
- disputes reference evidence, not status,  
- ownership boundaries are respected,  
- trust emerges from understanding.

Understanding, not compliance, validates adoption.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

PLLO reinforces:

- Cross-Site Trust & Verification  
- Human-Centered Outcome Aggregation  
- Long-Term Integrity & Drift Resistance  
- Anti-Centralization Safeguard  
- Civilizational Memory Ledger  

It is the **empowerment layer** of Phase B.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Phase B)

> If proof literacy does not exist locally,  
> the system is extractive.

Participants must be able  
to stand behind their own truth.
