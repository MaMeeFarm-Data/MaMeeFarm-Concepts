# ⚙️ Implementation #3: Minimal Proof Capture Units (MPUs)  
### *Reducing Proof Capture to the Smallest Honest, Verifiable Action*

> “If recording truth feels heavy,  
> people will stop recording.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Cycle 6 Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Minimal Proof Capture Units (MPUs)** define the **smallest honest, verifiable unit of proof** that can be recorded in real environments—quickly, repeatedly, and without disrupting work.

MPUs prioritize **continuity over completeness**.

---

## 2 · Why Large Proof Units Fail

Proof systems fail when capture requires:

- long forms or narratives,  
- multiple required fields,  
- perfect conditions,  
- explanation before evidence,  
- cognitive overhead.

MPUs reduce proof to **what must not be lost**.

---

## 3 · Implementation Definition

MPUs mandate that:

- proof can be captured in seconds,  
- a single action can be sufficient,  
- context is additive, not mandatory,  
- repeated MPUs compose larger truth,  
- absence of data is explicit, not filled.

Small truth beats delayed perfection.

---

## 4 · MPU Architecture

An MPU consists of five minimal elements:

### **A. Evidence Atom**
Photo, short clip, sensor reading, or mark.

### **B. Local Timestamp**
Captured as-is, without synchronization.

### **C. Hash-First Integrity**
Immediate hash at capture time.

### **D. Actor Reference**
Who captured it (explicit or anonymous).

### **E. Context Pointer (Optional)**
Links added later without altering the atom.

---

## 5 · Design Principles

### **5.1 Seconds, Not Minutes**
Capture time must be trivial.

### **5.2 No Mandatory Narrative**
Evidence precedes explanation.

### **5.3 Composition Over Completeness**
Many small proofs form a whole.

### **5.4 Explicit Gaps**
What is missing stays missing.

### **5.5 Human Rhythm Alignment**
Fits natural work flow.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

MPUs ensure that:

- tired people still record truth,  
- low-literacy environments participate,  
- speed does not sacrifice honesty,  
- no one is excluded by tooling,  
- dignity survives repetition.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> One photo of real work  
> is better than a perfect report never written.

---

## 7 · Validation Criteria

Minimal Proof Capture Units are valid when:

- capture takes only moments,  
- proof remains verifiable later,  
- aggregation reconstructs reality,  
- missing context is visible,  
- people continue capturing daily.

Continuity validates the unit.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

MPUs reinforce:

- Field-Ready Proof Systems  
- Offline-First Proof  
- Hash-First Integrity  
- Human Error Visibility  
- Daily Proof Continuity  

They are the **atomic layer** of Cycle 6.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Cycle 6)

> If proof capture interrupts work,  
> the unit is too large.

Truth must be capturable  
**in the middle of life**.
