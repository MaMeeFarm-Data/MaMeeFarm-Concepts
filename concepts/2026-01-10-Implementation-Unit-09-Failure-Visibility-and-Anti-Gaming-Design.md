# 🚨 Implementation Unit #9: Failure Visibility & Anti-Gaming Design  
### *Ensuring Honest Systems Under Failure While Preventing Metric Manipulation*

> “If failure is punished or hidden,  
> truth will disappear.”  
> — MaMeeFarm™, Cycle 5 Notes

## 1 · Abstract

**Failure Visibility & Anti-Gaming Design (FVAG)** is the ninth implementation unit of Cycle 5.  
Its purpose is to ensure that **failure remains visible, recordable, and useful**, while **system incentives actively block gaming, performative compliance, and metric manipulation**.

FVAG treats failure as **first-class evidence**, not a defect to be concealed.

---

## 2 · Why Systems Lie Under Pressure

Most systems drift into dishonesty because:

- failure is penalized,  
- metrics become survival tools,  
- incentives reward appearances,  
- narratives override evidence,  
- actors learn to game targets.

FVAG removes the motivation and ability to lie.

---

## 3 · Unit Definition

FVAG mandates that:

- failure is captured with the same rigor as success,  
- incomplete or negative outcomes are valid proofs,  
- metrics cannot be optimized without evidence,  
- narrative substitution is structurally blocked,  
- honesty is safer than performance.

The system rewards **truthfulness over optics**.

---

## 4 · Failure Visibility Mechanisms

FVAG implements five mechanisms:

### **A. Symmetric Proof Requirements**
Failure and success require equal documentation.

### **B. Non-Punitive Failure Capture**
Recording failure does not trigger sanctions.

### **C. Gap & Interruption Logging**
Missing data and halted work are explicit signals.

### **D. Temporal Consistency Checks**
Sudden “perfect runs” are flagged for review.

### **E. Public Traceability**
Claims must link back to raw proof.

Failure becomes **observable, not shameful**.

---

## 5 · Anti-Gaming Design Principles

### **5.1 No Single Metric Authority**
Multiple dimensions prevent target fixation.

### **5.2 Proof Over Score**
Evidence outranks numbers.

### **5.3 Incentive Neutralization**
Optimizing metrics alone yields no advantage.

### **5.4 Pattern-Based Anomaly Detection**
Gaming leaves detectable traces.

### **5.5 Reversible Claims**
All summaries can be decomposed to proof.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

FVAG ensures that:

- people are not punished for honesty,  
- survival under hardship is respected,  
- failure does not erase dignity,  
- transparency does not become exposure,  
- trust grows from consistency, not perfection.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> A day with no eggs, broken tools,  
> or exhaustion  
> is **valid data**, not a bad look.

---

## 7 · System Effects

With FVAG active:

- data quality improves under stress,  
- gaming becomes unprofitable,  
- learning accelerates from mistakes,  
- AI trains on real distributions,  
- integrity survives scale and incentives.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

FVAG integrates with:

- Constraint-Aware Evaluation  
- Human-Centered Outcome Aggregation  
- Cross-Site Trust & Verification  
- Regenerative Governance Loop  
- Proof-First Implementation Principle  

It is the **integrity shield** of Cycle 5.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Cycle 5)

> If a system makes failure unsafe to record,  
> the system is lying.

Honesty under failure  
**is a non-negotiable requirement**.
