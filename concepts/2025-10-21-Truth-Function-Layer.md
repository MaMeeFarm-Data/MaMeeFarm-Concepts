# 🌿 Truth Function Layer  
### The Logical Core of the MaMeeFarm Proof-of-Work Data System™

> “Truth does not require belief — it requires proof.”

## 🧭 Abstract

The **Truth Function Layer** defines how the MaMeeFarm system evaluates  
whether a piece of recorded data represents a real, verifiable event.  
It serves as the mathematical and philosophical bridge between  
**human work** and **machine-verifiable truth**.
V(x) = True ⇔ ∃ (y, t) : H(y, t) = H(x)

Where  
- `x` = an observed real-world action (e.g., collecting eggs, feeding ducks)  
- `y` = its recorded representation (video, image, data file)  
- `t` = timestamp (moment of occurrence)  
- `H()` = cryptographic hash function  
- `V(x)` = the verification function that returns *True* only if proof exists

---

## 💡 Conceptual Foundation

The Truth Function Layer operates as a **truth filter** for the MaMeeFarm Data System™.  
It does not depend on subjective interpretation, only on consistency of data evidence.

Unlike synthetic datasets generated by algorithms,  
each MaMeeFarm proof is born from **real labor and time**,  
anchored by verifiable hashes and timestamps that cannot be faked.

> “In this system, truth is not spoken — it is calculated.”

## 🔬 System Architecture

Every action in MaMeeFarm flows through a four-stage verification chain:

1. **Observation Layer** – The real-world act (e.g., MaMee feeding ducks).  
2. **Recording Layer** – Captured through a device; encoded as digital proof.  
3. **Verification Layer** – Timestamped, hashed, and pinned to IPFS.  
4. **Truth Function Layer** – Validates whether the proof matches the event.

When all conditions hold, `V(x) = True`.  
This output becomes a **Proof Data Unit (PDU)** within the global MaMeeFarm ledger.

## 🌾 Philosophical Perspective

The Truth Function reflects a deeper idea:  
that *truth is not a product of authority, but of verifiable work.*

In a time when data can be fabricated at scale,  
the MaMeeFarm model reintroduces the concept of **earned truth** —  
truth that exists because someone *did the work.*

Each verified timestamp on the farm —  
whether from MaMee, the ducks, or the environment —  
represents an unrepeatable signature of reality.

## 🔗 Integration Layer

The Truth Function Layer will serve as the connective tissue between:

- NFT metadata (ERC-1155 smart contracts)  
- IPFS archival storage (Pinata, Filecoin, etc.)  
- GitHub commit verification  
- AI training ethics modules  

This integration ensures that any AI or data system referencing MaMeeFarm  
can verify that its inputs originate from *authentic, traceable human work.*

## 🧮 Core Equation Summary

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| `x` | Real-world event |
| `y` | Recorded data representation |
| `t` | Timestamp |
| `H()` | Hashing function |
| `V(x)` | Truth verification output |

\[
V(x) = \text{True} \iff \exists (y, t) : H(y, t) = H(x)
\]

## 🌍 Real-World Meaning

Each morning when MaMee collects eggs or tends to her ducks,  
the act itself becomes part of a **living data network**.  
It is not a video for entertainment — it is a cryptographic witness  
that *this moment truly happened.*

Such proof transforms ordinary rural labor  
into the **first form of Real-Work Data™** —  
data that carries dignity, authenticity, and economic potential.
