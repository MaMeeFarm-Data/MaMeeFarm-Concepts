# Replication #10
## License Scope Definition
### Structural Boundary Enforcement

---

## 1. Abstract

License continuity without scope clarity creates interpretative expansion risk.

Replication #10 establishes explicit structural boundaries for DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- eliminate ambiguous interpretation of permitted use,
- define prohibited structural replication,
- separate study from operational implementation,
- prevent incremental expansion of rights through silence,
- formalize boundary enforcement.

---

## 3. Scope Boundaries

The following are NOT permitted without written authorization:

- Structural reuse of governance framework
- Operational deployment of DGCP system logic
- AI training using proprietary structure
- Derivative architectural replication
- Commercial adaptation
- Governance implementation in third-party systems

Permitted:

- Viewing
- Study
- Citation with attribution
- Hyperlink reference

---

## 4. Boundary Logic

Ambiguity expands rights.

Clarity preserves structure.

This replication layer defines boundary clarity as a stability requirement.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

License continuity requires scope definition.

Undefined boundaries create structural erosion.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
