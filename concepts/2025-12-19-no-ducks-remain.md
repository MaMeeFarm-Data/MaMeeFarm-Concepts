# No Ducks Remain — End of the Duck Line at MaMeeFarm

**Date:** 2025-12-19  
**Location:** MaMeeFarm, Lampang, Thailand  
**Status:** All ducks are gone. Zero remaining.

Today marks a critical and painful moment in MaMeeFarm’s history.

From a beginning of **7 ducks**, the number has gradually declined through real-life events, until this day —  
**there are no ducks left at the farm.**

This is not a symbolic statement.  
This is a factual record.

No ducks remain in the coop.  
No ducks remain in the field.  
No ducks remain as living data sources.

What remains is:

- The evidence of their existence  
- The daily proofs recorded while they lived  
- The traceable history of care, loss, and reality  
- And the human decision to continue documenting truth, even when it hurts

This record is written to affirm that:

> DGCP does not record only success.  
> It records **reality**.

The absence of ducks today is itself a form of proof —  
a proof of depletion, fragility, and the limits of life under real conditions.

MaMeeFarm continues,  
not as a story of abundance,  
but as a story of **truth that does not disappear when value is gone.**
