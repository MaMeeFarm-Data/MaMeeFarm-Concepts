# Replication #14
## Proof Supremacy
### Evidence Over Assertion Principle

---

## 1. Abstract

Governance stability requires evidence-based validation.

Replication #14 establishes that proof prevails over narrative, authority, or interpretation.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- prioritize cryptographic and documented evidence,
- prevent authority-based override of record,
- eliminate narrative dominance over proof,
- ensure that disputes resolve through verifiable documentation.

---

## 3. Core Principle

Assertion does not override proof.

Authority does not override evidence.

Silence does not invalidate record.

---

## 4. Governance Logic

DGCP™ operates under:

Proof > Interpretation  
Record > Opinion  
Documentation > Narrative  

---

## 5. Stability Rule

If evidence exists, it governs.

If evidence does not exist, no structural claim is valid.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
