# Replication #8  
## Jurisdictional Neutrality  
### Structural Stability Across Legal Environments

---

## 1. Abstract

Replication must remain stable across differing legal and regulatory environments.

Jurisdictional neutrality ensures that structural rules do not depend on a single legal system for validity.

---

## 2. Purpose

This layer exists to:

- protect structural integrity beyond national boundaries,
- prevent legal centralization from distorting governance,
- ensure consistency of enforcement logic,
- maintain proof-based continuity regardless of location.

---

## 3. Structural Principles

1. Governance logic is structurally defined, not geographically dependent.
2. License clarity remains constant across jurisdictions.
3. Enforcement is architectural, not regulatory.
4. Operational activation requires explicit agreement, regardless of territory.
5. Foundational year (© 2025) remains anchored.

---

## 4. Replication Logic

If replication depends on a single jurisdiction,  
scale becomes fragile.

If replication is structurally neutral,  
stability increases across environments.

---

## 5. Stability Rule

Legal context may vary.  
Structural definition must not.

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Study and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires a paid license agreement and written authorization.
