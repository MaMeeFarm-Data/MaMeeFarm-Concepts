# Replication #9
## License Continuity
### Foundational Identifier Stability

---

## 1. Abstract

This document defines Replication #9: License Continuity.

Structural stability across time requires license continuity.
A stable system cannot tolerate identifier drift created by annual renaming.

---

## 2. Internal Directive

Effective immediately, the license identifier:

**DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025**

shall be treated as the **Foundational License Name**.

The suffix “2025” denotes the year of origin and does not represent an annual renewal requirement.  
No annual renaming is authorized.

---

## 3. Implementation Rules

1. License name remains: **DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025**
2. Copyright line must read: **© 2025–Present MaMeeFarm™**
3. All future Replication, Concept, Whitepaper, Proof, and Dataset documents must:
   - preserve the original license identifier
   - avoid year-based renaming
   - maintain temporal continuity
4. Any structural modification to license scope requires formal written amendment.

---

## 4. Governance Alignment

This directive aligns with:

Replication #9 — Temporal Integrity

Structural stability across time requires license continuity.  
License drift is treated as a structural risk.

---

## 5. Effective Status

License status: Active  
Drift risk: Mitigated  
Temporal anchor: Preserved  

---

## Final Rule

If permission is not explicitly granted in writing, usage is not authorized.

Viewing, study, and citation with proper attribution are permitted.  
Operational system use requires written authorization and a paid license agreement.
