# üåæ Origin of Real-Work Data

The concept of **Real-Work Data** was born from the struggle of a small farm to survive without external funding.  
Every daily act ‚Äî collecting eggs, feeding ducks, planting lemongrass ‚Äî became not just labor, but **proof of existence**.

In traditional systems, data are extracted **from** people.  
In MaMeeFarm, data are created **by** people ‚Äî through real work that sustains life.

> ‚ÄúA camera records more than an image ‚Äî it records time, truth, and effort.‚Äù

Each record is a *Proof Data Unit (PDU)*:  
`PDU = (timestamp, action, signature, hash)`

When connected and verified, these form a **self-authenticating data layer** ‚Äî  
the foundation of the MaMeeFarm Proof-of-Work Data System‚Ñ¢.
