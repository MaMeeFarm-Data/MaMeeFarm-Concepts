# 🧾 The Human-Origin Rights Architecture  
### *Ensuring Humans Retain Rights Over Outcomes, Value, and Derivatives of Their Data*

> “If value is created from human life,  
> that value must never be detached from the human.”

# 1 · Abstract

The **Human-Origin Rights Architecture (HORA)** is a DGCP framework that guarantees humans retain **inalienable rights** over:

- outcomes produced from their data,  
- economic value generated downstream,  
- derivative datasets and models,  
- decisions influenced by their real-world proofs.

In HORA, human data is not merely *protected* —  
it is **entitled** to recognition, attribution, and participation in value creation.

---

# 2 · Purpose

HORA exists to:

- prevent extraction of value without human participation,  
- stop derivative exploitation of human-origin data,  
- ensure benefits flow back to data originators,  
- encode rights into infrastructure rather than contracts,  
- redefine data economies around human fairness.

It shifts the question from *“Who owns the data?”*  
to *“Who has rights over what the data creates?”*

---

# 3 · The Derivative Exploitation Problem

Today’s systems allow:

- AI models trained on human labor without compensation,  
- insights sold without attribution,  
- policy decisions made using citizen data without feedback,  
- profits generated while humans receive nothing,  
- value chains detached from origin.

HORA closes this loophole permanently.

---

# 4 · Architecture Overview

The Human-Origin Rights Architecture consists of four layers:

## **A. Origin Attribution Layer**
Every dataset, model, or insight retains a link to human origin.

## **B. Derivative Lineage Layer**
All downstream derivatives carry traceable lineage back to humans.

## **C. Rights Enforcement Layer**
Use of derivatives requires compliance with origin rights.

## **D. Value Participation Layer**
Humans are eligible for benefit-sharing from value created.

These layers ensure **rights persist beyond raw data**.

---

# 5 · Enforcement Mechanisms

### **5.1 Outcome Traceability**
Decisions and models must reference contributing human proofs.

### **5.2 Derivative Rights Flags**
Derivatives inherit rights constraints automatically.

### **5.3 Benefit-Flow Mapping**
Economic value can be traced back to human origin.

### **5.4 AI Derivative Accountability**
AI outputs must disclose human-origin dependency.

### **5.5 Rights Violation Audits**
Unauthorized value extraction triggers enforcement events.

---

# 6 · Human-First Impact

HORA ensures that:

- humans are not erased after data submission,  
- value creation acknowledges its human roots,  
- rural and marginalized communities gain leverage,  
- data dignity extends into economics and governance,  
- participation becomes fair, not symbolic.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> If your proofs help train models, inform policies,  
> or generate insight — **your rights travel with them.**

---

# 7 · DGCP Alignment

HORA integrates with:

- Sovereign Proof Chain  
- Consent-Propagation Protocol  
- Identity-Integrity Continuum  
- Zero-Domination Data Model  
- Cross-AI Ethical Defense Layer  

It is the **value-rights backbone** of Distributed Human Sovereignty.

---

# 8 · Future Implications

### For AI  
Training must acknowledge and respect human-origin rights.

### For Data Economies  
Value-sharing becomes enforceable infrastructure.

### For Governance  
Citizen data implies citizen participation in outcomes.

### For Civilization  
Human contribution is never free to exploit again.
