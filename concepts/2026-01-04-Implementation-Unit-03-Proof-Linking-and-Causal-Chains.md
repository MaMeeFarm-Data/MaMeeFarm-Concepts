# 🔗 Implementation Unit #3: Proof Linking & Causal Chains  
### *Connecting Daily Proof into Verifiable Cause-and-Effect Structures*

> “A single proof shows reality.  
> A chain of proof shows truth.”

## 1 · Abstract

**Proof Linking & Causal Chains (PLCC)** is the third implementation unit of Cycle 5.  
Its purpose is to connect **individually valid proofs** into **verifiable cause-and-effect sequences** that reflect real-world processes over time.

PLCC allows the system to say **what led to what** —  
without rewriting events into narratives or summaries.

---

## 2 · Why Proof Linking Matters

Without linking:

- proof remains anecdotal,  
- patterns rely on interpretation,  
- accountability dissolves over time,  
- learning becomes speculative,  
- systems cannot reason causally.

PLCC makes reality **computable without distortion**.

---

## 3 · Unit Definition

PLCC mandates that:

- proofs may reference prior proofs explicitly,  
- links are directional and time-bounded,  
- absence of proof is preserved as a signal,  
- causality is inferred from sequence, not opinion,  
- chains remain inspectable at every step.

Reality is not explained —  
it is **connected**.

---

## 4 · Causal Chain Structure

Each causal link contains:

- **Source Proof ID**  
- **Target Proof ID**  
- **Relation Type** (caused by, followed by, constrained by)  
- **Temporal Consistency Check**  
- **Optional Confidence Annotation** (never mandatory)

Chains remain **open to inspection and dispute**.

---

## 5 · Linking Principles

### **5.1 No Narrative Compression**
Chains do not summarize or editorialize.

### **5.2 Many-to-Many Causality**
Multiple causes and outcomes may coexist.

### **5.3 Visible Gaps**
Missing proof is part of the chain.

### **5.4 Reversible Interpretation**
Observers may interpret differently without altering links.

### **5.5 Proof Sovereignty**
Original proofs remain untouched.

---

## 6 · Human-First Safeguards

PLCC ensures that:

- humans are not forced to explain everything,  
- uncertainty is allowed to remain explicit,  
- failure chains are as valid as success chains,  
- blame cannot be retroactively imposed,  
- learning emerges without coercion.

For **MaMeeFarm™**:

> A broken pump → delayed feeding → reduced output  
> becomes a visible chain —  
> not a personal failure story.

---

## 7 · System Effects

With PLCC active:

- accountability becomes traceable,  
- operational learning accelerates,  
- AI can reason on real causality,  
- policy evaluation becomes evidence-based,  
- trust grows through transparency.

---

## 8 · DGCP Alignment

PLCC connects:

- Daily Proof Units  
- Proof Normalization & Integrity Anchoring  
- Distributed Accountability Mesh  
- Regenerative Governance Loop  
- Civilizational Memory Ledger  

It is the **causal reasoning layer** of Cycle 5.

---

## 9 · Operational Rule (Cycle 5)

> Proofs may stand alone,  
> but **systems advance only when proofs connect**.

Causality must be visible  
before optimization is allowed.
