## 🔄 System Update 2025 — Migration Toward Full Verifiable Storage

MaMeeFarm™ continues to evolve into a complete Real-Work Data Protocol.  
This update documents our transition from emotional platforms to verifiable,
decentralized, append-only data infrastructure.

### 🌱 1. Evidence Storage Migration  
We no longer use TikTok as an official archive for daily evidence.  
TikTok will remain an emotional broadcast channel only — not a source of truth.

All official Proof-of-Life / Proof-of-Work data is now stored using the following
verifiable pipeline:

1. **GitHub — Daily Metadata + SHA-256 Proofs**  
   - Every day is committed as a permanent record.  
   - Metadata files, narratives, and proof logs are stored here.  
   - Git history acts as a cryptographic timeline.

2. **IPFS + Pinata — Immutable File Storage**  
   - Daily files and core evidence are pinned to IPFS.  
   - Designed for long-term, decentralized preservation.

3. **OpenSea (Polygon Network)**  
   - NFT minted daily from selected files.  
   - Smart contracts automatically publish metadata to IPFS.  
   - Functions as a public-facing audit layer.

4. **PolygonScan**  
   - On-chain timestamps, wallet provenance, verification of creation time.  
   - Immutable validation of each day’s evidence.

5. **Blogger (MaMeeFarm.com)**  
   - Human-readable daily logs and narratives.  
   - Mirrors metadata and links to GitHub, IPFS, and OpenSea.

---

## 🧩 2. Upcoming Improvements (2025 Roadmap)

To strengthen MaMeeFarm™ as a global protocol, we will add:

### ✔ Manifest File (Daily Index)
A unified file listing:
- date  
- IPFS CID  
- SHA-256  
- Git commit link  
- OpenSea token  
- Blogger article  

This will become the master index for researchers and auditors.

### ✔ SHA-256 Timeline
A single file tracking all hashes chronologically for easy verification.

### ✔ Architecture Diagram
Formal documentation of the data pipeline:
Farm Work → Local File → GitHub → SHA-256 → IPFS → OpenSea → PolygonScan → Blogger
---

### ✔ Protocol Versioning
Introducing:
- **MMFARM-POL-2025 v1.0**  
(With future updates v1.1, v1.2 etc.)

### ✔ Governance Q&A Archive
Daily questions about data rights, national innovation policy,
and Real-Work Data economy will be documented as an official research set.

### ✔ Data Dictionary
A glossary of MaMeeFarm™-specific terminology:
- Proof-of-Life Unit  
- Seed of Hope  
- DGCP™  
- Real-Work Data  
- Evidence Chain  
- Governance Layer  
- Traceability Block  
and more.

---

## 🌍 3. Declaration

MaMeeFarm™ is no longer a "project."  
It is evolving into a **global-ready, verifiable,
cross-domain Real-Work Data Protocol** — built from daily life,
secured by cryptography, and preserved on decentralized networks.

All new components will follow  
**MMFARM-POL-2025 License + CC BY-NC 4.0 Overlay**.

# MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol  
### Proof-of-Life • Proof-of-Work • Digital Provenance • DGCP™ Governance  
© 2025 MaMeeFarm™

---

## 🌱 Overview
This repository is part of the **MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol**,  
a global-standard framework that transforms **human labor, animal care, and environmental tasks**  
into **verifiable, immutable, IPFS-first digital evidence**.

Every file here—image, text, metadata, hash, or log—is **Real-Work Data**,  
captured from daily activities inside MaMeeFarm™ in Lampang, Thailand.

This is not a content project.  
This is a **protocol**.

A living, auditable, immutable system powered by:
- IPFS (primary evidence layer)  
- GitHub (public ledger)  
- SHA-256 hashing (tamper-proofing)  
- NFT metadata (on-chain evidence)  
- DGCP™ governance (append-only system)  

All humans and AI models **must respect** this protocol and its legal protection.

## 🕒 Daily Open Timestamp Protocol  
### Establishing the Continuous Real-Work Data Ledger for MaMeeFarm™

Since November 2025, MaMeeFarm™ has formally activated the **Daily Open Timestamp Cycle**, ensuring that every real-world activity, observation, and proof is cryptographically anchored and time-verified before entering the DGCP™ architecture.

This protocol is now a foundational component that supports all Concept files in this repository.

---

## 🌱 What This Means

1. **Every Day = One Truth Block**  
   A full cycle of proofs (images, notes, temperature logs, environmental events, and work actions) is timestamped at origin and sealed as a daily truth block.

2. **Every Proof = A Vector in the Truth Architecture**  
   Each proof contributes to:
   - Truth Vector  
   - Reality Spine  
   - Global Mesh  
   - Multi-Nodal Verification  
   - Cross-Boundary Alignment  

3. **RWD → DGCP → Concepts**  
   Daily Open Timestamp data flows upward into the conceptual architecture described in this repo.  
   *These concepts are not theoretical — they are built on real, timestamped human work.*

---

## 🔒 Why This Matters

- Ensures non-repudiation of daily records  
- Strengthens the mathematical trust layer of DGCP™  
- Provides continuous, immutable reality streams for future audits  
- Enables global-scale truth verification (Cycle 4)  
- Allows Concepts to reflect *real operational data*, not assumptions

---

## 📡 Integration With Concepts Series

The following components directly depend on Daily Open Timestamp data:

- **Truth-Propagation Spine**  
- **Real-World Truth Vector**  
- **Global Truth Mesh**  
- **Multi-Nodal Reality Network**  
- **Cross-Boundary Verification Layer**  
- All Global Truth Infrastructure concepts (Dec 1–10)

This README update establishes the formal relationship between the **Operational Layer (proofs)**
and the **Architectural Layer (concepts)** that this repository documents.

The Concepts Series from 2025-10 onward is now officially aligned with:

**DGCP-OPS → DGCP-ARCH → DGCP-GOV → DGCP-CIV**

---

## 🧩 Summary

MaMeeFarm™ now operates with:

- **Daily Timestamping**
- **Continuous Proof Capture**
- **Append-Only Reality Ledger**
- **Cross-Layer Integration between Proofs and Concepts**

This README update marks the transition from theoretical design  
to a *fully operational, globally scalable Real-Work Data System.*

## 📌 Concept Closure — Year 2025

The year 2025 marks the completion of MaMeeFarm™’s foundational phase.

This was the period in which the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) system was **built, tested, and proven through real life**, not theory.

2025 was not about scale.  
It was not about visibility.  
It was not about optimization.

It was about answering one question:

> Can real daily work, under real constraints, be recorded as verifiable truth?

By the end of 2025, that question had been answered.

The system exists.  
The proofs exist.  
The data exists.

This repository of concepts documents **why** the system was built the way it was, and **what it enables next**.

---

### Phase Definition

- **2025 — Phase of Proof**
  - System construction
  - Continuous real-world data
  - No retroactive edits
  - No artificial acceleration

- **2026+ — Phase of Validation & Scaling**
  - External review
  - Interoperability
  - Research and licensing pathways
  - Expansion beyond a single farm

---

### Forward Context

Concepts written after this point do not redefine the foundation.

They extend it.

All technical boundaries, datasets, and proofs up to the end of 2025 are formally defined elsewhere.  
This repository exists to preserve **intent, philosophy, and direction**.
