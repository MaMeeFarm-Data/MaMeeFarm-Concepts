## 🧭 Overview

**MaMeeFarm-Concepts** is the **conceptual and philosophical layer**  
of the MaMeeFarm Proof-of-Work Data System™ (MMFARM-POL-2025).  
This repository records the **ideas, models, and system logic**  
that transform real-world agricultural work into verifiable digital data.

In the MaMeeFarm ecosystem:  
> - **TikTok** represents the *Proof of Existence (real work)*  
> - **NFTs** represent the *Proof of Ownership (digital assets)*  
> - **GitHub** represents the *Proof of Concept (knowledge & system layer)*  

Together, they form the first **Real-Work Data Architecture**  
connecting human labor, blockchain proof, and open research.
