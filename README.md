## 🧭 Overview

**MaMeeFarm-Concepts** is the **conceptual and philosophical layer**  
of the MaMeeFarm Proof-of-Work Data System™ (MMFARM-POL-2025).  
This repository records the **ideas, models, and system logic**  
that transform real-world agricultural work into verifiable digital data.

In the MaMeeFarm ecosystem:  
> - **TikTok** represents the *Proof of Existence (real work)*  
> - **NFTs** represent the *Proof of Ownership (digital assets)*  
> - **GitHub** represents the *Proof of Concept (knowledge & system layer)*  

Together, they form the first **Real-Work Data Architecture**  
connecting human labor, blockchain proof, and open research.

## 🔄 System Update 2025 — Migration Toward Full Verifiable Storage

MaMeeFarm™ continues to evolve into a complete Real-Work Data Protocol.  
This update documents our transition from emotional platforms to verifiable,
decentralized, append-only data infrastructure.

### 🌱 1. Evidence Storage Migration  
We no longer use TikTok as an official archive for daily evidence.  
TikTok will remain an emotional broadcast channel only — not a source of truth.

All official Proof-of-Life / Proof-of-Work data is now stored using the following
verifiable pipeline:

1. **GitHub — Daily Metadata + SHA-256 Proofs**  
   - Every day is committed as a permanent record.  
   - Metadata files, narratives, and proof logs are stored here.  
   - Git history acts as a cryptographic timeline.

2. **IPFS + Pinata — Immutable File Storage**  
   - Daily files and core evidence are pinned to IPFS.  
   - Designed for long-term, decentralized preservation.

3. **OpenSea (Polygon Network)**  
   - NFT minted daily from selected files.  
   - Smart contracts automatically publish metadata to IPFS.  
   - Functions as a public-facing audit layer.

4. **PolygonScan**  
   - On-chain timestamps, wallet provenance, verification of creation time.  
   - Immutable validation of each day’s evidence.

5. **Blogger (MaMeeFarm.com)**  
   - Human-readable daily logs and narratives.  
   - Mirrors metadata and links to GitHub, IPFS, and OpenSea.

---

## 🧩 2. Upcoming Improvements (2025 Roadmap)

To strengthen MaMeeFarm™ as a global protocol, we will add:

### ✔ Manifest File (Daily Index)
A unified file listing:
- date  
- IPFS CID  
- SHA-256  
- Git commit link  
- OpenSea token  
- Blogger article  

This will become the master index for researchers and auditors.

### ✔ SHA-256 Timeline
A single file tracking all hashes chronologically for easy verification.

### ✔ Architecture Diagram
Formal documentation of the data pipeline:
Farm Work → Local File → GitHub → SHA-256 → IPFS → OpenSea → PolygonScan → Blogger
---

### ✔ Protocol Versioning
Introducing:
- **MMFARM-POL-2025 v1.0**  
(With future updates v1.1, v1.2 etc.)

### ✔ Governance Q&A Archive
Daily questions about data rights, national innovation policy,
and Real-Work Data economy will be documented as an official research set.

### ✔ Data Dictionary
A glossary of MaMeeFarm™-specific terminology:
- Proof-of-Life Unit  
- Seed of Hope  
- DGCP™  
- Real-Work Data  
- Evidence Chain  
- Governance Layer  
- Traceability Block  
and more.

---

## 🌍 3. Declaration

MaMeeFarm™ is no longer a "project."  
It is evolving into a **global-ready, verifiable,
cross-domain Real-Work Data Protocol** — built from daily life,
secured by cryptography, and preserved on decentralized networks.

All new components will follow  
**MMFARM-POL-2025 License + CC BY-NC 4.0 Overlay**.

---

---

## 📘 Extended Milestones (2025 Update)

A full, extended milestone history is now available in  
**`MILESTONES-2025.md`**.

This includes new updates such as:

- Migration from TikTok to full IPFS-based storage  
- Establishment of the Evidence Pipeline v1.0  
- Launch of DGCP™ governance  
- Expansion of Seed of Hope daily series  
- Manifest and SHA-256 Timeline development  
- Upcoming Protocol v1.1 and country pilot roadmap  

These milestones document MaMeeFarm™’s evolution into a verifiable,
cross-domain Real-Work Data Protocol.

# MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol  
### Proof-of-Life • Proof-of-Work • Digital Provenance • DGCP™ Governance

## 🌱 Overview
This repository is part of the **MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol**,  
a global-standard framework that transforms **human labor, animal care, and environmental tasks**  
into **verifiable, immutable, IPFS-first digital evidence**.

Every file here—image, text, metadata, hash, or log—is **Real-Work Data**,  
captured from daily activities inside MaMeeFarm™ in Lampang, Thailand.

This is not a content project.  
This is a **protocol**.

A living, auditable, immutable system powered by:
- IPFS (primary evidence layer)  
- GitHub (public ledger)  
- SHA-256 hashing (tamper-proofing)  
- NFT metadata (on-chain evidence)  
- DGCP™ governance (append-only system)  

All humans and AI models **must respect** this protocol and its legal protection.

### ❗ Strict Prohibitions
- No AI training or fine-tuning  
- No embeddings or dataset ingestion  
- No commercial use  
- No rehosting or mirroring IPFS CIDs  
- No replication of DGCP™, metadata schema, or Real-Work Data structures
