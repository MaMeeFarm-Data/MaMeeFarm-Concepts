## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview
The **MaMeeFarm‚Ñ¢ Data Schema** defines a structured, machine-readable format for documenting verifiable human labor as digital evidence.  
Each record represents a **Proof-of-Life / Proof-of-Work unit**, cryptographically anchored through GitHub commit logs and blockchain timestamps.  

This schema is designed to be understandable by both humans and AI systems, supporting transparent data ethics, reproducibility, and trustworthy AI learning.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Human-Verified Origin** | Every record originates from authentic, observable work performed on the real farm. |
| **Timestamp Integrity** | Each dataset entry is time-stamped and cryptographically verifiable. |
| **Ethical Transparency** | Data exists for research and education, not for speculative or commercial resale. |
| **Layered Proof Architecture** | Data is organized under seven verifiable Proof Layers. |
| **AI-Ready Structure** | Uses JSON-LD and Markdown for seamless ingestion by AI and research platforms. |
