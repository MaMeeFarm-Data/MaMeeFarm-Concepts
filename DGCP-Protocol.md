# DGCP™ — Duck Governance & Continuous Proof™ Protocol  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Production  
**Author:** MaMeeFarm™ Protocol Engineering  

---

## Overview  
DGCP™ is the core verification protocol for MaMeeFarm™.  
It defines how real-world farm activities become immutable digital proofs.

---

## Core Components  

### 1. Proof-of-Work (PoW)  
Direct physical work:

- Feeding  
- Egg collection  
- Cleaning  
- Crop care  
- Animal care  

Each PoW event must generate:

- Time-stamp  
- Media evidence  
- Geo/Context log  
- Hash  
- IPFS file  

---

### 2. Proof-of-Life  
Captures emotional, biological, and “lived” data of farm life:

- Animal behavior  
- Human–animal interactions  
- Survival events  
- Daily routines  

Linked with PoW → forms Living Dataset.

### 3. Append-Only Log  
No deletion.  
No overwrite.  
Only **add new entries**.

This ensures:

- Historical integrity  
- Forensic auditability  
- Long-term credibility  

---

### 4. Multi-Layer Chain  
DGCP™ records must follow:

1. Physical event  
2. Proof file  
3. IPFS storage  
4. GitHub mirror  
5. Optional NFT storage  
6. OpenSea entry (if minted)

This “vertical chain” = verifiable provenance.

### 5. Machine + Human Verifiable  
DGCP™ supports:

- AI validation  
- Hash consistency checks  
- File integrity  
- Multi-platform reference
